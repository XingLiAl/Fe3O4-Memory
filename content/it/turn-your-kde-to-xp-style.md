KDE is a beautiful and highly customizable desktop environment, so can we turn it to Windows XP style?

## Themes
Yes, you're right. I do nearly all of these with the help of themes created by KDE community. I've picked out some of them which is similar to Windows XP.

How to install themes:
1. Open System system settings and choose Appearance
2. Navigate to section you want
3. Here you can install themes from local files or download them through a dialog

### Global theme
[Expose](https://store.kde.org/p/1479063/)

it contains
- Plasma style
- Colors
- Window decorations
- Splash screen (I don't recommend it because it's not like XP at all)

### Application Style
MS Windows 9x (KDE built in)

### GNOME/GTK application style

### Icons
[Windows XP icon theme pack](https://store.kde.org/p/1215836/)

### Cursors

### Splash screen
Set to None

### Wallpaper
[Bliss](https://store.kde.org/p/1389609/)

The most famous wallpaper from Windows XP.

## Configures
All of KDE and Kwin settings are available in System settings application. You can tweak them freely.

Enjoy your fake Windows XP.
