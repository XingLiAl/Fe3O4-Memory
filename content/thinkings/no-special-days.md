> Saying goodbye to festivals, live on you own and enjoy a happier life.

Special days, usually known as festivals, are very common in our life and we've been involved in them nearly all the time. However, I think it's time to say goodbye to them.



It was just the last day of my term-ending exam that I heard something unacceptable. Hair cutting isn't allowed in Lunar January due local customs. It was shocking and have made me full of anger. A few minutes later, lots of things like this came to my mind, such as giving red pack(a envelope which contains money) to relatives' children, eating something special on specific day, etc. Are they really responsible?



I think they're absolutely not. For one thing, we're all on the road of fighting for our own future. We should do anything we like that is beneficial to us, instead of being restricted by some useless rules. For another, they're completely meaningless because all the days in a year is normal, no exceptions. It's no use to celebrate a certain day including your birthday, which is only a sign of your arrival, not more.



There are still something more meaningful to do than being involved in a special day. For example, take up a book to start reading, turn on your laptop for some coding, or even spend a few hours sleeping during such a wonderful holiday, while they're still wasting their time in lots of complex celebration.



In addition, if some events or some person are really significant to you, then you're supposed to remind yourself of them whenever you're available, not just a certain day. And it should be brought up by yourself, without any specific food, ceremony, etc.



For example, we're suggested to spend Spring Festival in our working area by the traffic authorities due to COVID-19. I've fully supporting to this piece of advice, for we can visit our parents any time whenever your parents and you are all available. It'll decrease the potential risk of infection and reduce the stress of public transportation like train, long-distance bus.



We are all unique in the society and our life can get improved largely if we are live for ourselves. You're independent and shouldn't be restricted irresponsibly. That why I write this article.
